## Course Meeting Times

Seminars: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

## Course Enrollment

This seminar is designed for students who are enrolled in MIT's [Political Science PhD Program](https://polisci.mit.edu/graduate/phd). We reserve the right to approve other students.

## Course Description

This course explores the political implications of the ethnic differences embedded within states and societies.  We will be seeking to understand the nature of collective identities, the driving forces underlying their persistence and change, their mobilization, and their intersection with and effect on the nation-state system, which remains the basis for political organization around the world today.  Our discussions will be comparative and theoretical, while also engaging concrete examples.  The study of identity politics intersects with all of the fields of political science, and the theory and literature learned in this seminar will have relevance for anyone working on identity-related issues in any part of the discipline.

## Course Objectives

Our central purpose will be to explore the major conceptual approaches and theoretical debates relating to the causes and consequences of ethnic politics to prepare students to conduct original scholarly work in this field.  The seminar will be a collective project, in that everyone will be expected to contribute to our discussions and debates.  Although the primary focus of the course is political, our discussions will include key literature from other social scientific disciplines (anthropology, psychology, economics, sociology, and history), as the questions with which we are dealing cut across disciplinary boundaries and are of broad social scientific concern.  The course aims to provide students with the intellectual resources to construct their own framework to understand these phenomena, as well as an opportunity to apply this knowledge to concrete situations.  It seeks to expose students to a broad range of approaches in the study of identity politics and to provide them with the theoretical and analytical tools to be able to design and conduct research in this area.
